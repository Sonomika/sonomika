# Cursor Rules - Hard Constraints for AI Assistant

## Git Operations
- NEVER push to Git unless explicitly requested by user

## Project-Specific Rules
- NEVER hardcode effects in any file outside of src/effects/ directory
- NEVER add fallback effect imports in utils/EffectLoader.ts
- NEVER reference specific effect files outside effects folder
- ONLY use dynamic discovery patterns
- ZERO EXCEPTIONS: Any hardcoded effect reference outside effects/ is a violation
- ALWAYS open electron app, not website
- ALWAYS use react fiber to render the composite video
- NEVER create monolithic long files - break large files into smaller, focused modules

## UI Design Rules
- KEEP UI minimal and clean - avoid unnecessary visual clutter
- NEVER add unneeded icons unless essential for functionality
- ONLY use icons for essential controls (play, fast-forward, rewind, stop, etc.)
- NEVER use emoji anywhere in the code or UI
- Prioritize functionality over decorative elements
