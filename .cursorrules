# Cursor Rules - Hard Constraints for AI Assistant

## Git Operations
- NEVER push to Git unless explicitly requested by user

## Project-Specific Rules
- NEVER hardcode effects in any file outside of src/effects/ directory
- NEVER add fallback effect imports in utils/EffectLoader.ts
- NEVER reference specific effect files outside effects folder
- ONLY use dynamic discovery patterns
- ZERO EXCEPTIONS: Any hardcoded effect reference outside effects/ is a violation
- ALWAYS use react fiber to render the composite video
- NEVER create monolithic long files - break large files into smaller, focused modules

## UI Design Rules
- KEEP UI minimal and clean - avoid unnecessary visual clutter
- NEVER add unneeded icons unless essential for functionality
- ONLY use icons for essential controls (play, fast-forward, rewind, stop, etc.)
- NEVER use emoji anywhere in the code or UI
- Prioritize functionality over decorative elements

## Design Tokens
- GREY palette is restricted to FOUR shades only (Tailwind neutral mapped accordingly):
  - 900 (surface): #141414
  - 800 (panel): #1f1f1f
  - 600/700 (borders/controls): #262626
  - 200–500 (muted text): #aaaaaa
- DO NOT use other grey hex values (e.g., #111, #333, #444, #555, #666, #888, #ccc). Replace with the allowed shades.
- Prefer Tailwind `tw-*-neutral-*` utilities; no inline grey hex in components (effects may define their own colors).

- Font sizes are limited to TWO sizes only:
  - 12px: use `tw-text-xs`
  - 14px: use `tw-text-sm` (default body size)
- DO NOT use other `tw-text-*` sizes or arbitrary `tw-text-[…]` font sizes.

## UI Component Governance
- BEFORE adding any new UI component, FIRST check `src/components/ui` for an existing equivalent (Button, Input, Select, Dialog, etc.) and reuse it.
- If a required component exists but needs small tweaks, extend via props or minimal wrapper instead of creating a new component.
- Only introduce a new UI component when no suitable one exists in `src/components/ui`; then add it there with consistent styling and export via `src/components/ui/index.ts`.

## Security Rules
- ALWAYS keep keys secure - never hardcode API keys, secrets, or sensitive credentials in code
